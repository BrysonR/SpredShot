docker-compose can be used to set up partial environments as well as boot the entire infrastructure.

Basic commands:

#build new versions of containers defined in the "build" section of the yaml
docker-compose build

#start up the web container and it's dependencies (links)
docker-compose up web

#stop all containers for the application
docker-compose stop
